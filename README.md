# Employee-Payroll-Tracker
This sweet guy is able to make a table that not only stores your employees first and last names, but also their salaries.
It has two more extra functions, in the console it will output your employees average salary and it will pick a random employee to win the raffle.
Enjoy! - Austin Hurst
